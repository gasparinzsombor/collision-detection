# My Project

## Overview

This project is a Dash web application that visualizes a rectangular graph structure similar to the one shown in the initial design. The graph is rendered using Plotly, and the relationships between the nodes are defined using NetworkX. The visualization includes customizable nodes and edges that simulate a grid-like layout.

### Features:
- Visualizes graph-like structures.
- Interactive, web-based UI built with Dash.
- Nodes and edges are rendered using Plotly for smooth visualizations.
- NetworkX is used for building and managing the graph structure.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed on your machine. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### Setup Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have the `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install dash plotly networkx
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start a local web server, and you can view the app by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` in your web browser.

- `app.py`: Contains the code to define and run the Dash web application.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies needed for this project.
- `venv/`: The virtual environment folder.

## Customization

You can modify the node layout, edges, and appearance by editing the `app.py` file, particularly the section where the graph is defined using NetworkX and Plotly.

## Dependencies

- [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) - Web application framework for Python.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) - Used for creating visualizations.
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) - Library for creating and analyzing graphs.
